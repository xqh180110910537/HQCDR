# HQCDR

## 🧑‍⚕ Origin of the Dataset

The **HQCDR** dataset was constructed by ophthalmologists, containing high-quality retinal fundus images with lesion-level annotations. 

## 📊 Dataset Overview

We provide a statistical overview of lesion types included in the **HQCDR** dataset, based on a subset of **107 annotated retinal images**. This analysis helps researchers understand the composition of the dataset and supports lesion-aware model development and evaluation.

**Included Lesion Types:**

- **MA** – Microaneurysm  
- **HE** – Hemorrhage  
- **EX** – Hard Exudates  
- **SE** – Soft Exudates  
- **RH** – Roth Spots  
- **NV** – Neovascularization  
- **DS** – Drusen
